    body: '[{"page":1,"pages":3,"per_page":"10","total":21},[{"id":"1","value":"Agriculture
      & Rural Development","sourceNote":"For the 70 percent of the world''s poor who
      live in rural areas, agriculture is the main source of income and employment.
      But depletion and degradation of land and water pose serious challenges to producing
      enough food and other agricultural products to sustain livelihoods here and
      meet the needs of urban populations. Data presented here include measures of
      agricultural inputs, outputs, and productivity compiled by the UN''s Food and
      Agriculture Organization."},{"id":"2","value":"Aid Effectiveness","sourceNote":"Aid
      effectiveness is the impact that aid has in reducing poverty and inequality,
      increasing growth, building capacity, and accelerating achievement of the Millennium
      Development Goals set by the international community. Indicators here cover
      aid received as well as progress in reducing poverty and improving education,
      health, and other measures of human welfare."},{"id":"3","value":"Economy &
      Growth","sourceNote":"Economic growth is central to economic development. When
      national income grows, real people benefit. While there is no known formula
      for stimulating economic growth, data can help policy-makers better understand
      their countries'' economic situations and guide any work toward improvement.
      Data here covers measures of economic growth, such as gross domestic product
      (GDP) and gross national income (GNI). It also includes indicators representing
      factors known to be relevant to economic growth, such as capital stock, employment,
      investment, savings, consumption, government spending, imports, and exports."},{"id":"4","value":"Education","sourceNote":"Education
      is one of the most powerful instruments for reducing poverty and inequality
      and lays a foundation for sustained economic growth. The World Bank compiles
      data on education inputs, participation, efficiency, and outcomes. Data on education
      are compiled by the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization
      (UNESCO) Institute for Statistics from official responses to surveys and from
      reports provided by education authorities in each country."},{"id":"5","value":"Energy
      & Mining","sourceNote":"The world economy needs ever-increasing amounts of energy
      to sustain economic growth, raise living standards, and reduce poverty. But
      today''s trends in energy use are not sustainable. As the world''s population
      grows and economies become more industrialized, nonrenewable energy sources
      will become scarcer and more costly. Data here on energy production, use, dependency,
      and efficiency are compiled by the World Bank from the International Energy
      Agency and the Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center."},{"id":"6","value":"Environment","sourceNote":"Natural
      and man-made environmental resources – fresh water, clean air, forests, grasslands,
      marine resources, and agro-ecosystems – provide sustenance and a foundation
      for social and economic development.  The need to safeguard these resources
      crosses all borders.  Today, the World Bank is one of the key promoters and
      financiers of environmental upgrading in the developing world. Data here cover
      forests, biodiversity, emissions, and pollution. Other indicators relevant to
      the environment are found under data pages for Agriculture & Rural Development,
      Energy & Mining, Infrastructure, and Urban Development."},{"id":"7","value":"Financial
      Sector","sourceNote":"An economy''s financial markets are critical to its overall
      development. Banking systems and stock markets enhance growth, the main factor
      in poverty reduction. Strong financial systems provide reliable and accessible
      information that lowers transaction costs, which in turn bolsters resource allocation
      and economic growth. Indicators here include the size and liquidity of stock
      markets; the accessibility, stability, and efficiency of financial systems;
      and international migration and workers\\ remittances, which affect growth and
      social welfare in both sending and receiving countries."},{"id":"8","value":"Health","sourceNote":"Improving
      health is central to the Millennium Development Goals, and the public sector
      is the main provider of health care in developing countries. To reduce inequities,
      many countries have emphasized primary health care, including immunization,
      sanitation, access to safe drinking water, and safe motherhood initiatives.  Data
      here cover health systems, disease prevention, reproductive health, nutrition,
      and population dynamics. Data are from the United Nations Population Division,
      World Health Organization, United Nations Children''s Fund, the Joint United
      Nations Programme on HIV\/AIDS, and various other sources."},{"id":"9","value":"Infrastructure","sourceNote":"Infrastructure
      helps determine the success of manufacturing and agricultural activities. Investments
      in water, sanitation, energy, housing, and transport also improve lives and
      help reduce poverty. And new information and communication technologies promote
      growth, improve delivery of health and other services, expand the reach of education,
      and support social and cultural advances. Data here are compiled from such sources
      as the International Road Federation, Containerisation International, the International
      Civil Aviation Organization, the International Energy Association, and the International
      Telecommunications Union."},{"id":"10","value":"Social Protection & Labor","sourceNote":"The
      supply of labor available in an economy includes people who are employed, those
      who are unemployed but seeking work, and first-time job-seekers. Not everyone
      who works is included: unpaid workers, family workers, and students are often
      omitted, while some countries do not count members of the armed forces. Data
      on labor and employment are compiled by the International Labour Organization
      (ILO) from labor force surveys, censuses, establishment censuses and surveys,
      and administrative records such as employment exchange registers and unemployment
      insurance schemes."}]]'
