    body: '[{"page":1,"pages":1,"per_page":"50","total":21},[{"id":"1","value":"Agriculture
      & Rural Development","sourceNote":"For the 70 percent of the world''s poor who
      live in rural areas, agriculture is the main source of income and employment.
      But depletion and degradation of land and water pose serious challenges to producing
      enough food and other agricultural products to sustain livelihoods here and
      meet the needs of urban populations. Data presented here include measures of
      agricultural inputs, outputs, and productivity compiled by the UN''s Food and
      Agriculture Organization."},{"id":"2","value":"Aid Effectiveness","sourceNote":"Aid
      effectiveness is the impact that aid has in reducing poverty and inequality,
      increasing growth, building capacity, and accelerating achievement of the Millennium
      Development Goals set by the international community. Indicators here cover
      aid received as well as progress in reducing poverty and improving education,
      health, and other measures of human welfare."},{"id":"3","value":"Economy &
      Growth","sourceNote":"Economic growth is central to economic development. When
      national income grows, real people benefit. While there is no known formula
      for stimulating economic growth, data can help policy-makers better understand
      their countries'' economic situations and guide any work toward improvement.
      Data here covers measures of economic growth, such as gross domestic product
      (GDP) and gross national income (GNI). It also includes indicators representing
      factors known to be relevant to economic growth, such as capital stock, employment,
      investment, savings, consumption, government spending, imports, and exports."},{"id":"4","value":"Education","sourceNote":"Education
      is one of the most powerful instruments for reducing poverty and inequality
      and lays a foundation for sustained economic growth. The World Bank compiles
      data on education inputs, participation, efficiency, and outcomes. Data on education
      are compiled by the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization
      (UNESCO) Institute for Statistics from official responses to surveys and from
      reports provided by education authorities in each country."},{"id":"5","value":"Energy
      & Mining","sourceNote":"The world economy needs ever-increasing amounts of energy
      to sustain economic growth, raise living standards, and reduce poverty. But
      today''s trends in energy use are not sustainable. As the world''s population
      grows and economies become more industrialized, nonrenewable energy sources
      will become scarcer and more costly. Data here on energy production, use, dependency,
      and efficiency are compiled by the World Bank from the International Energy
      Agency and the Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center."},{"id":"6","value":"Environment","sourceNote":"Natural
      and man-made environmental resources – fresh water, clean air, forests, grasslands,
      marine resources, and agro-ecosystems – provide sustenance and a foundation
      for social and economic development.  The need to safeguard these resources
      crosses all borders.  Today, the World Bank is one of the key promoters and
      financiers of environmental upgrading in the developing world. Data here cover
      forests, biodiversity, emissions, and pollution. Other indicators relevant to
      the environment are found under data pages for Agriculture & Rural Development,
      Energy & Mining, Infrastructure, and Urban Development."},{"id":"7","value":"Financial
      Sector","sourceNote":"An economy''s financial markets are critical to its overall
      development. Banking systems and stock markets enhance growth, the main factor
      in poverty reduction. Strong financial systems provide reliable and accessible
      information that lowers transaction costs, which in turn bolsters resource allocation
      and economic growth. Indicators here include the size and liquidity of stock
      markets; the accessibility, stability, and efficiency of financial systems;
      and international migration and workers\\ remittances, which affect growth and
      social welfare in both sending and receiving countries."},{"id":"8","value":"Health","sourceNote":"Improving
      health is central to the Millennium Development Goals, and the public sector
      is the main provider of health care in developing countries. To reduce inequities,
      many countries have emphasized primary health care, including immunization,
      sanitation, access to safe drinking water, and safe motherhood initiatives.  Data
      here cover health systems, disease prevention, reproductive health, nutrition,
      and population dynamics. Data are from the United Nations Population Division,
      World Health Organization, United Nations Children''s Fund, the Joint United
      Nations Programme on HIV\/AIDS, and various other sources."},{"id":"9","value":"Infrastructure","sourceNote":"Infrastructure
      helps determine the success of manufacturing and agricultural activities. Investments
      in water, sanitation, energy, housing, and transport also improve lives and
      help reduce poverty. And new information and communication technologies promote
      growth, improve delivery of health and other services, expand the reach of education,
      and support social and cultural advances. Data here are compiled from such sources
      as the International Road Federation, Containerisation International, the International
      Civil Aviation Organization, the International Energy Association, and the International
      Telecommunications Union."},{"id":"10","value":"Social Protection & Labor","sourceNote":"The
      supply of labor available in an economy includes people who are employed, those
      who are unemployed but seeking work, and first-time job-seekers. Not everyone
      who works is included: unpaid workers, family workers, and students are often
      omitted, while some countries do not count members of the armed forces. Data
      on labor and employment are compiled by the International Labour Organization
      (ILO) from labor force surveys, censuses, establishment censuses and surveys,
      and administrative records such as employment exchange registers and unemployment
      insurance schemes."},{"id":"11","value":"Poverty","sourceNote":"For countries
      with an active poverty monitoring program, the World Bank—in collaboration with
      national institutions, other development agencies, and civil society—regularly
      conducts analytical work to assess the extent and causes of poverty and inequality,
      examine the impact of growth and public policy, and review household survey
      data and measurement methods.  Data here includes poverty and inequality measures
      generated from analytical reports, from national poverty monitoring programs,
      and from the World Bank’s Development Research Group which has been producing
      internationally comparable and global poverty estimates and lines since 1990."},{"id":"12","value":"Private
      Sector","sourceNote":"Private markets drive economic growth, tapping initiative
      and investment to create productive jobs and raise incomes. Trade is also a
      driver of economic growth as it integrates developing countries into the world
      economy and generates benefits for their people.  Data on the private sector
      and trade are from the World Bank Group''s Private Participation in Infrastructure
      Project Database, Enterprise Surveys, and Doing Business Indicators, as well
      as from the International Monetary Fund''s Balance of Payments database and
      International Financial Statistics, the UN Commission on Trade and Development,
      the World Trade Organization, and various other sources."},{"id":"13","value":"Public
      Sector","sourceNote":"Effective governments improve people''s standard of living
      by ensuring access to essential services –  health, education, water and sanitation,
      electricity, transport – and the opportunity to live and work in peace and security.
      Data here includes World Bank staff assessments of country performance in economic
      management, structural policies, policies for social inclusion and equity, and
      public sector management and institutions for the poorest countries. Also included
      are indicators on revenues and expenses from the International Monetary Fund''s
      Government Finance Statistics, and on tax policies from various sources."},{"id":"14","value":"Science
      & Technology","sourceNote":"Technological innovation, often fueled by governments,
      drives industrial growth and helps raise living standards. Data here aims to
      shed light on countries technology base: research and development, scientific
      and technical journal articles, high-technology exports, royalty and license
      fees, and patents and trademarks. Sources include the UNESCO Institute for Statistics,
      the U.S. National Science Board, the UN Statistics Division, the International
      Monetary Fund, and the World Intellectual Property Organization."},{"id":"15","value":"Social
      Development","sourceNote":"Data here cover child labor, gender issues, refugees,
      and asylum seekers. Children in many countries work long hours, often combining
      studying with work for pay. The data on their paid work are from household surveys
      conducted by the International Labour Organization (ILO), the United Nations
      Children''s Fund (UNICEF), the World Bank, and national statistical offices.
      Gender disparities are measured using a compilation of data on key topics such
      as education, health, labor force participation, and political participation.  Data
      on refugees are from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees complemented
      by statistics on Palestinian refugees under the mandate of the United Nations
      Relief and Works Agency."},{"id":"16","value":"Urban Development","sourceNote":"Cities
      can be tremendously efficient. It is easier to provide water and sanitation
      to people living closer together, while access to health, education, and other
      social and cultural services is also much more readily available. However, as
      cities grow, the cost of meeting basic needs increases, as does the strain on
      the environment and natural resources. Data on urbanization, traffic and congestion,
      and air pollution are from the United Nations Population Division, World Health
      Organization, International Road Federation, World Resources Institute, and
      other sources."},{"id":"17","value":"Gender","sourceNote":"Gender equality is
      a core development objective in its own right. It is also smart development
      policy and sound business practice. It is integral to economic growth, business
      growth and good development outcomes. Gender equality can boost productivity,
      enhance prospects for the next generation, build resilience, and make institutions
      more representative and effective.  In December 2015, the World Bank Group Board
      discussed our new Gender Equality Strategy 2016-2023, which aims to address
      persistent gaps and proposed a sharpened focus on more and better gender data.
      The Bank Group is continually scaling up commitments and expanding partnerships
      to fill significant gaps in gender data. The database hosts the latest sex-disaggregated
      data and gender statistics covering demography, education, health, access to
      economic opportunities, public life and decision-making, and agency."},{"id":"18","value":"Millenium
      development goals","sourceNote":""},{"id":"19","value":"Climate Change","sourceNote":"Climate
      change is expected to hit developing countries the hardest. Its effects—higher
      temperatures, changes in precipitation patterns, rising sea levels, and more
      frequent weather-related disasters—pose risks for agriculture, food, and water
      supplies. At stake are recent gains in the fight against poverty, hunger and
      disease, and the lives and livelihoods of billions of people in developing countries.
      Addressing climate change requires unprecedented global cooperation across borders.
      The World Bank Group is helping support developing countries and contributing
      to a global solution, while tailoring our approach to the differing needs of
      developing country partners.  Data here cover climate systems, exposure to climate
      impacts, resilience, greenhouse gas emissions, and energy use.  Other indicators
      relevant to climate change are found under other data pages, particularly Environment,
      Agriculture & Rural Development, Energy & Mining, Health, Infrastructure, Poverty,
      and Urban Development."},{"id":"20","value":"External Debt","sourceNote":"Debt
      statistics provide a detailed picture of debt stocks and flows of developing
      countries. Data presented as part of the Quarterly External Debt Statistics
      takes a closer look at the external debt of high-income countries and emerging
      markets to enable a more complete understanding of global financial flows. The
      Quarterly Public Sector Debt database provides further data on public sector
      valuation methods, debt instruments, and clearly defined tiers of debt for central,
      state and local government, as well as extra-budgetary agencies and funds. Data
      are gathered from national statistical organizations and central banks as well
      as by various major multilateral institutions and World Bank staff."},{"id":"21","value":"Trade","sourceNote":"Trade
      is a key means to fight poverty and achieve the Millennium Development Goals,
      specifically by improving developing country access to markets, and supporting
      a rules based, predictable trading system. In cooperation with other international
      development partners, the World Bank launched the Transparency in Trade Initiative
      to provide free and easy access to data on country-specific trade policies."}]]'
